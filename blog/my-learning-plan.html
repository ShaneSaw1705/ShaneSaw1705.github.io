      <p>As I begin this course, I am aware of my weaknesses and I am determined to overcome them. I have identified the following areas that I need to work on:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Time management</li>
        <li>Ego</li>
        <li>Discipline</li>
      </ul>
      <div class="divider"></div>
      <p>Here is my plan to address these weaknesses:</p>
      <h3>Time management</h3>
      <p>I will create a study schedule that includes dedicated time for each subject. I will set aside time each day to review the material and complete assignments. I will also use a planner to keep track of deadlines and due dates.</p>
      <h3>My ego</h3>
      <p>I will allocate time out of my day to work on my own projects to keep my brain working in a coding environment and continue to grow my skills and knowledge by continueing with my own learning.</p>
      <h3>Discipline</h3>
      <p>I often find myself getting side tracked in things I shouldnt be doing, which relates back to the side projects. I think working on my own projects would be a great use of my time to keep developing as a developer.</p>
      <div class="divider"></div>
      <p>By following this plan, I am confident that I will be able to overcome my weaknesses and succeed in this course. I am excited to see how much I will grow and learn over the next few months.</p>
