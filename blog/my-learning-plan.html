      <h2>My career goal</h2>
      <p>I have been coding for years for absoloutely free and working jobs I hate in the mean time.</p>
      <p>My goal is to reclaim my life by turning my passion in to a career and being able to provide for me and my partner. Dev Academy plays a huge roal in this dream, providing the environment to be a part of a team! Which is something you cant get as a solo however, it is a vital part of getting in to the industry</p>
      <p>A big weakness of mine comes when you look beyond the code, I often struggle to understand myself and be able to sell myself. I am hoping that Dev Academy will help bring the best out of me and help me tackle my weaknesses in this domain. and I hope that the Facilitation team will help keep me accountable and be there should I need the help.</p>
      <div class="divider"></div>
      <p>As I begin this course, I am aware of my weaknesses and I am determined to overcome them. I have identified the following areas that I need to work on:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Time management</li>
        <li>Ego</li>
        <li>Discipline</li>
        <li>My communication skills</li>
      </ul>
      <div class="divider"></div>
      <p>Here is my plan to address these weaknesses:</p>
      <h3>Time management</h3>
      <p>I will create a study schedule that includes dedicated time for each subject. I will set aside time each day to review the material and complete assignments. I will also use a planner to keep track of deadlines and due dates.</p>
      <h3>My ego</h3>
      <p>I will allocate time out of my day to work on my own projects to keep my brain working in a coding environment and continue to grow my skills and knowledge by continueing with my own learning.</p>
      <h3>Discipline</h3>
      <p>I often find myself getting side tracked in things I shouldnt be doing, which relates back to the side projects. I think working on my own projects would be a great use of my time to keep developing as a developer. I have a hard schedule to work around due to my current life situation but I am going to dedicate 90 minute blocks throught the day for solid work. Studys show that smaller time blocks of work lead to higher returns in productivity</p>
      <h3>Communication</h3>
      <p>I need to take the time to learn more about myself. I will make an effort to spend more of my time reflecting</p>
      <div class="divider"></div>
      <p>But its not all bad. I do have alot of strengths in the art of coding</p>
      <ul>
        <li>I have been a self taught programmer for 10+ years and I have had the opertunity to learn an arsenal of coding languages</li>
        <li>I have a strong understanding of the fundamentals of programming</li>
        <li>I have a passion for learning and I am always looking for new ways to improve my skills</li>
      </ul>
      <div class="divider"></div>
      <p>By following this plan, I am confident that I will be able to overcome my weaknesses and succeed in this course. I am excited to see how much I will grow and learn over the next few months. I also am going to interact with my class mates more and engage myself more often.</p>
