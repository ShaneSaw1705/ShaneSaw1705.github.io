                <h2>About me</h2>
                <p>My name is Shane Curtis and I am a fullstack developer. I was born in the south island of newzealand in a town called christchurch where I got very used to making new friends; my parents were always on the move
                    due to the careers they had. I have always been interested in technology and how it works, so I decided to pursue a career in software development.
                </p>
                <p>My coding journey began with my love of gaming and how these amazing people breath life into these creative worlds using code. 
                    I began creating games when I was 8 and have been coding ever since. I have a passion for learning and I am always looking for new ways to improve my skills. Which brings me to now, I realized while creating web apps that
                    it was never the game development I fell in love with but the code itself. I am now a fullstack developer and I am loving every minute of it.
